## What are webhooks

It is an event-driven approach that ensures a service provider can send the right notification to the right external services at the time it occurs. In another way, it is a machine to machine architectural pattern that enables a client API to receive updates to data as they happen, rather than polling for the latest updates.

## How it works

When an event is fired inside Price Edge that a webhook is registered to, a request will be sent to the registered endpoint with the following signature




```http
POST {REGISTERED ENDPOINT} HTTP/1.1
x-priceedge-webhook-signature: {SHA512 Signature}
content-type: application/json

{
	"eventType": "change",
	"eventTime": "2023-06-14 15:54:10",
	"eventId": "3DD64E28-4455-40C9-BE02-DEB7D5E39B76",
	"source": "table",
	"sourceObject": "Extension_Factors"
}

OR

{
	"eventType": "change",
	"eventTime": "2023-06-14 15:54:10",
	"eventId": "3DD64E28-4455-40C9-BE02-DEB7D5E39B76",
	"source": "pepe",
	"sourceObject": "NextRRP"
}

OR
{
  "eventType": "change",
  "eventTime": "2023-06-22 16:59:14",
  "eventId": "13069F5C-EC73-437F-9842-F51C77CA01C4",
  "source": "pepe",
  "sourceObject": "Suggested_Price",
  "pageNumber": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "cd_ItemNumber": "100011",
      "cd_PriceList": "SE",
      "Value": 127
    },
    {
      "cd_ItemNumber": "100012",
      "cd_PriceList": "NO",
      "Value": 209.25
    }
	]
}
```

## Register a new web hook
<Warning>If you choose "includeData": true, the max repsonse body size is 8000 chars, which can result in invalid JSON if longer </Warning>
``` Http
PUT {api_url}/api/system/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "externalUrl": "https://webhook.site/3431a3c0-a123-4e24-9bbc-5ae0acf780d9",
    "sharedSecret": "bamboo", //any text, it will be used in the signature
    "eventType":"change",
    "eventSource":"table", //pepe, table
    "eventSourceObject":"Item_Extension", //pepe(price)column or table name
		"includeData": false, //optional; true/false if expeted alot of data then false
}
```


## List registered web hooks

``` Http
GET {api_url}/api/system/webhooks
```

## Unregister web hooks

``` Http
DELETE {api_url}/api/system/webhooks/{ID}
```

## Test web hooks

This will simulate a change in the object it is registered to. It could mean that other hooks registered to the same event will also receive a ping *(this behaviour will change in the future to only send the notification to this specific webhook)*

``` Http
POST {api_url}/api/system/webhooks/{ID} 
```
